# Libft
Introduction
C programming can be very tedious when one doesn’t have access to those highly useful
standard functions. This project allows you to re-write those functions, understand them,
and learn to use them. This library will help you with all your future C projects.
Take the time to expand your libft throughout the year. But always, make sure to
check which functions are allowed.

 Part 1 - Libc functions
In this first part, you must re-code a set of the libc functions, as defined in their
man. Your functions will need to present the same prototype and behaviors as the originals. Your functions’ names must be prefixed by “ft_”. For instance strlen becomes
ft_strlen.

Part 2 - Additional functions
In this second part, you must code a set of functions that are either not included in the
libc, or included in a different form. Some of these functions can be useful to write Part
1’s functions.

Bonus part
If you completed the mandatory part, you’ll enjoy taking it further. You can see this last
section as Bonus Points.
Having functions to manipulate memory and strings is very useful, but you’ll soon
discover that having functions to manipulate lists is even more useful.
make bonus will add the bonus functions to the libft.a library.
